# Boston_Housing_Data
Mini Project Linear Regression

A small project looking into variable correlation in the Boston Housing Data set from Harvard's CS 109 course materials. In this project I work with both statsmodels and scikit-learn to create and evaluate linear regression models. I also look into Leverage plots and their utility in data cleaning.
